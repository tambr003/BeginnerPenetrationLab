# BeginnerPenetrationLab

A personal wiki for documenting progress, notes, and experiments in penetration testing within a controlled home lab environment. It is designed to track methodologies, tools, findings, and lessons learned as I build and practice offensive security skills.



Goals

---> Keep organized, versioned notes on penetration testing workflows.

---> Document each lab machine's setup, vulnerabilities, and exploitation path.

---> Track successful and failed attack chains for future reference.

---> Build a structured library of tools, cheat sheets, and resources.



Repository Structure

---> "targets/": Notes per machine (recon, exploitation, cleanup).

---> "tools/": Usage guides and cheat sheets for common penetration testing tools.

---> "exploits/": Writeups of exploitation chains tested in the lab.

---> "docs/": General methodology, references, and study notes.

---> "evidence/": Screenshots, logs, and proofs.



Usage

---> Notes are written in Markdown for readability and version control.

---> Each target has its own page documenting recon, vulnerabilities, and post-exploitation steps.

---> Tools and scripts are documented with usage examples and references.

---> Evidence is not published to GitHub - sensitive data is stored locally in "evidence/" and excluded via .gitignore.



Disclaimer

All testing and documentation are done in my own isolated lab or in environments where I have explicit permission. This repository is for educational and personal learning purposes only. Do not use these notes, commands, or techniques on systems you do not own or have written consent to test.
